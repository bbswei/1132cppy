## Book Management System
Description
The publishing industry frequently handles books that have multiple authors and different editions. To effectively manage such books, software systems must accurately represent each book's details. In this exercise, you will create a Book class that can accommodate these requirements.

Instructions
You need to implement a Book class with the following features:

Attributes
title: a string representing the title of the book.
authors: a list of strings representing the authors of the book.
publication_year: an integer representing the year the book was
edition: a string representing the edition of the book.
Initialization (__init__ method)
String representation (__str__ method): This method should return a string in the following format:
"Title: {title}; Authors: {authors}; Year: {publication_year}; Edition: {edition}"
Other methods:
add_author
remove_author
update_edition
update_publication_year
update_title
Notes:
The {authors} section should be seperated by a comma and a space.
The {authors} section should be sorted in alphabetical order.
Input
The first line contains a number representing the testcase count.

The folllowing 4 lines contain the book's information.

After that, the command lines will be given after a line of dash (“-”), and end with a line of three dashes (“—”).

Commands are as follows:

add_author {author}
rm_author {author}
update_edition {edition}
update_pubyear {year}
update_title {title}
print

Output
Whenever the print command is given, the book's information should be printed.
