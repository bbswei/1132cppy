# Bubble sort
# You are given an unsorted list nums. 
# Your task is to sort this list with bubble sort. 
# However, it is too easy that asking you implement the algorithm. 
# In this question, you are ask to answer "the number of swap" during the bubble sort.
# Note that in our bubble sort, we want to get a increasing sorted list, and we also promise that the given list has no duplicate numbers.
