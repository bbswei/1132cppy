---- Assignment 6: Bank Account Management System ----
### Objective
Practice writing a Python program that applies object-oriented programming, exception handling, and date management to simulate a simple banking system.
### Description
Imagine you have been appointed as the lead architect of a brand-new digital bank!
Your mission is to build the core system that manages customer accounts with absolute precision.

The system must be able to:

Open new accounts for customers
Process deposits and withdrawals safely
Keep track of every account’s current balance
Enable smooth transfers between accounts
Close accounts securely once customers are ready to move on
And, of course, automatically apply monthly interest to reward your customers — without them even needing to ask!
Every day, your bank receives some transaction requests, each tagged with a date. The transactions are guaranteed to arrive in chronological order.

At the start of each new month, the system must apply the previous month's interest to every active account (Even accounts created shortly before month-end are entitled to the full interest for the previous month). The interest is calculated at a fixed rate of 1% per month of the current balance, truncated to the integer part, and then credited to the account immediately, before processing any new operations.

Build your Bank Account Management System carefully — your customers (and your reputation!) are counting on you.
