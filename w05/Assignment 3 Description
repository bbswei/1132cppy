---- Assignment 3: Ordering System ----
### Objective
Practice step-by-step program development by systematically verifying input, processing logic, and output format.
### Description
A restaurant receives multiple orders from different customers. Each customer places an order containing multiple food items, and each item has a specified quantity, unit price, and optional discount.

Your task is to process and calculate the total cost of each customer's order, applying discounts where applicable, and display a detailed order summary in the specified format.

Input
The first line contains a positive integer, which represents the number of customers.
For each customer, the input consists of:
A line containing the customer's name.
A line containing a positive integer 
, representing the number of food items ordered.
The next lines each describe a food item, formatted as follows:
Food Name;Quantity;Unit Price;Discount Code
Food Name: A string.
Quantity: A positive integer.
Unit Price: A floating-point number.
Discount Code: Either "DISC10" (10% discount), "DISC20" (20% discount), or "NONE" (no discount).

Output
For each customer, output the order summary as follows:
        Customer: <Name>
        Number of Items: <n>
        Order Details:
        1. <Food Name> - Quantity: <Quantity>, Unit Price: <Unit Price> TWD, Subtotal: <Subtotal> TWD
        2. <Food Name> - Quantity: <Quantity>, Unit Price: <Unit Price> TWD, Subtotal: <Subtotal> TWD
        ...
        Total Cost: <Total Cost> TWD
            
Each item should be numbered in order
All numerical values (unit price, subtotal, total cost) must be formatted to two decimal places (e.g., 35.00 TWD).
The total cost will be the sum of the subtotals after rounding to two decimal places.
There will be a line break after each customer.
